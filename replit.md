# Synapse Chamber

## Overview

Synapse Chamber is an AI training platform designed to create, manage, and train autonomous AI agents (AutoDev) through multi-platform interactions. The system acts as a sophisticated "neural chamber" where different AI platforms (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok) can interact, share knowledge, and collectively train AutoDev agents. The platform provides web automation capabilities to communicate with AI platforms through their web interfaces, comprehensive memory systems for knowledge retention, and analytics for tracking performance and progress.

## User Preferences
