in replit,we have tools like these.

1.Agent: Automated developer 
Agent is an automated developer that plans and generates entire projects, occasionally pausing to ask you for feedback.
Use Agent when you want to…
Build a new project from scratch
Generate a build plan for your project
Make complex, multi-step changes,

2.Dock: Open files & tools 
In addition to AI tools, you can access code files and other workspace features via the Dock.
Notice that Files has its own button at the top left.

3.Run Button: Preview your App
When working with Assistant, you can click the Run button at any time to see its output.
