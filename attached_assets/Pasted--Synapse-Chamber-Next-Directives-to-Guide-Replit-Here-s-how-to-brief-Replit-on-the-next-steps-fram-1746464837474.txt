 Synapse Chamber: Next Directives to Guide Replit
Here’s how to brief Replit on the next steps, framed like you're assigning tasks to your internal Replit Agent ⬇️

🧭 Synapse Chamber → Replit Action Plan (Phase II: Training Engine)
🧩 Objective:
Make Synapse Chamber train AutoDev the same way Replit Agent auto-debugs and tests your projects — autonomously, visibly, and with checkpointed feedback.

🪛 Next Feature to Build:
“Add a Training Engine that allows Synapse Chamber to conduct AI training sessions for AutoDev — fully interactive, auto-debuggable, and Replit-Agent-like.”

🛠️ Tasks to Assign (in order):
1. Add a Training Module to Synapse Chamber
Create a TrainingSessionManager class

Responsibilities:

Orchestrates multi-AI training rounds

Chooses topic (e.g., Natural Language, API Handling)

Gives all AIs the same prompt

Collects & logs answers

Aggregates a final recommendation

2. Add Session Logging & UI Progress Tracker
Every training step logs to a UI pane (like Replit’s testing output)

Status updates include:

“Starting training on X”

“Claude encountered issue Y — debugging…”

“Session complete. Summary: …”

Highlighted checkpoints: “✅ Claude said… GPT suggested… FINAL ACTION taken…”

3. Enable Topic-Specific Sessions
From the web UI, you should be able to select:

Topic (e.g., NLP, File Handling, API Auth)

Mode: “All AIs train”, or “1 AI teaches AutoDev”

Goal: Update AutoDev’s capabilities

4. Auto-Decision Execution
Synapse Chamber makes a final call from all AI responses

Updates AutoDev’s memory, logic, or scripts

Logs the change (like Git commit summaries)

🧬 Final Goal for This Phase:
You tell Synapse Chamber: “Train AutoDev on Natural Language Parsing.”
It spins up the training session → runs AI prompts → handles hiccups → logs everything → updates AutoDev → briefs you like a boss:

“Training complete. GPT provided best tokenizer pipeline. Claude flagged a regex issue (fixed). AutoDev updated. Logs stored under thread_NLP001.json.”

✅ After This: Host Itself
Once Synapse Chamber is stable and AutoDev is smart enough:

Add “Hosting Migration Module”

It scans platforms like Render, Railway, Vercel

Creates account, sets up deployment (via browser or later via API)

🧠 Reminder to Replit:
This is not just a debugging tool. It’s a compound AI lab. Each agent is a contributor. Synapse Chamber is the CTO. AutoDev is the product. Replit Agent is the blueprint. We move like clockwork with self-reporting, self-debugging, and real progress displayed at every turn.
